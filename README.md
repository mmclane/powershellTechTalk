# powershellTechTalk
Powershell script used to give a presentation to each the basics of learning powershell.

#History
A while back I gave a 20 minute presentation to my company on powershell.  My goal in this presentation was to give highlight some of the built in things that help you learn powershell.  I covered get-alias, get-command, get-module, get-help, get-member, etc.  I also talked about the pipeline, inputs, and outputs, who everything is an object, and more.

For this presentation, I decided that it would be more impactful if, instead of using powerpoint, I would just write the whole thing in powershell.  I had my powershell script throw up some ascii art, and "slides".  I also used the start-demo function.  I think I got it from here: https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Start-Demo/1.0/Content/Start-Demo.ps1

Someone later wanted to take a look at what I had done, so I started a project to share my work.  This project has all the files I used.  If you want to use them, feel free, just change the text, or edit as you need.  Please don't pretend to be me.
